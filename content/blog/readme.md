## Welcome

This is my technical blog where I document my increasingly unhinged explorations in **machine learning**, **natural language processing**, and **LLMs**. It's equal parts public notebook, trauma dump, and "hey, this actually worked" archive. If you're here for polished tutorials, you're probably in the wrong place. If you're here for "half part working and half part I don't know what I was thinking" welcome to *mi casa*.

## What You'll Probably Find Here

### Natural Language Processing
*Where I bully low-resource languages into giving up their secrets*

Raw investigations into text processing, cross-lingual word alignment, and building translation systems that actually work for languages Google Translate forgot. Featuring Mandyali and Kangri—because everyone else is sleeping on them and that's basically a war crime.

### LLM & RAG Systems
*Taking prototypes to production without losing my mind (most of the time)*

Production-grade RAG implementations, prompt engineering that's actually engineering, vector database wrangling, and scaling LLMs past the "it works on my machine" stage. Includes my actual latency benchmarks and the embarrassing mistakes that taught me what not to do.

## About Me

I'm **Lothnic** Mayank Joshi - an ML developer with main character energy and a production-first mindset. I build AI systems that ship, document my 2 AM debugging spirals, and believe the best learning happens when you're slightly in over your head. My Roman Empire is model drift in production.

## Tech Stack

- Languages:    Python (fluent), TypeScript (surviving), Rust (manifesting)
- ML:           PyTorch, Transformers, OpenNMT, Pathway (Heavy Lifting)
- Data:         Pandas, NumPy, xarray, Polars (because pandas was giving mid performance)
- Infra:        Docker, Modal, Vercel, Kafka (real-time or bust)
- Experiment(MLOps):   Weights & Biases, MLflow, too many spreadsheets
